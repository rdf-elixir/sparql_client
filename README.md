A [SPARQL protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/) client for Elixir.

## Features

- Executes all forms of SPARQL queries and updates against any SPARQL 1.0/1.1-compatible endpoint over HTTP
- Validates SPARQL queries before sending them to a SPARQL service endpoint (can be disabled via raw-mode)
- Supports result sets in both XML, JSON, CSV and TSV formats, with JSON being the preferred default for content-negotiation purposes
- Supports graph results in any RDF serialization format understood by [RDF.ex]
- Supports generation of updates (except for `INSERT` and `DELETE` updates), incl. `INSERT/DELETE DATA` updates from all [RDF.ex] data structures
- Works with multiple HTTP client libraries
